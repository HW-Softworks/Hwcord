# Hwcord

A fast, open-source Discord client modification tool

## FAQ

#### How is this different from different client modification tools?

Hwcord passes vanilla JS files straight to the Discord client during startup, instead of being preloaded with a patched ASAR file

## Features

- Fast code injection
- Ability to reinject currently injected javascript files
- Ability to reload the Discord client
- Built in "menu" (open with INS) and loader

## Issues

- Injecting multiple files doesn't work well
- You might get logged out of Discord if you reload too frequently

## Roadmap

- Ability to Multi-Inject files

- Built in Plugin menu in settings

- Ability to inject live without restarting the process


## Usage/Examples
You can download a pre-compiled version of Hwcord and get to scripting your own features, or use it straight from the Node JS binary by downloading source and using 'npm install' + 'npm start'
